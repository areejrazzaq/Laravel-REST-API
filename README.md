## Laravel REST API with Sanctum

A simple CRUD application built on [Laravel](https://laravel.com) Framework. This is an example of a REST API using auth tokens with Laravel Sanctum.

The application is a guided project by [Media Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT-GJQIY3EU&t=32s). Kudos to Brad !!.
